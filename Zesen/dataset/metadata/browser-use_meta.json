    "Dockerfile": "### Building and Running Docker for `browser-use`\n\nTo build and run the Docker container using the provided `Dockerfile` from the `browser-use` repository, follow these steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Clone the Repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use.git\ncd browser-use\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Build the Docker Image\n```bash\ndocker build . -t browseruse --no-cache\n```\n- This command builds the Docker image named `browseruse` without using any cached layers, ensuring a fresh build.\n\n#### Step 3: Run the Docker Container\nTo run the container and mount a local directory for data persistence:\n```bash\ndocker run -v \"$PWD/data\":/data browseruse\n```\n- This command mounts the local `data` directory to the `/data` directory in the container.\n\nTo check the version of the `browser-use` application:\n```bash\ndocker run -v \"$PWD/data\":/data browseruse --version\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Multi-Architecture Build (Optional)\nIf you need to build for multiple architectures:\n```bash\ndocker buildx create --use\ndocker buildx build . --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t browseruse/browseruse:some-tag\n```\n- This command sets up a build environment for multiple architectures and pushes the built image to a specified tag.\n\n### Semantic Meaning of the Dockerfile\nThe `Dockerfile` defines a containerized environment for the `browser-use` application, which automates web tasks for AI agents. Key components include:\n\n- **Base Image**: Starts from `python:3.12-slim`, ensuring a lightweight Python environment.\n- **Labels**: Metadata about the image, including name, maintainer, and documentation links.\n- **Environment Variables**: Configures the container's environment, including timezone, language, and user settings.\n- **User Creation**: Sets up a non-privileged user (`browseruse`) for running the application securely.\n- **Dependency Installation**: Installs necessary system and Python dependencies, including Chromium and Playwright.\n- **Working Directory**: Sets the working directory to `/app`, where the application code resides.\n- **Entrypoint**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which is the `browser-use` application.\n\nThis setup ensures that the application runs in a consistent environment, with all dependencies managed and isolated from the host system.",
    ".dockerignore": "### Building and Running Docker with `.dockerignore` in `browser-use`\n\n#### Overview of `.dockerignore`\nThe `.dockerignore` file is used to specify files and directories that should be excluded from the Docker build context. This helps to reduce the size of the context sent to the Docker daemon, speeding up the build process and ensuring sensitive or unnecessary files are not included in the Docker image.\n\n#### Semantic Meaning of the Entries\n1. **Documentation and Static Files**: \n   - `docs/` and `static/` are excluded as they are not needed for the application runtime.\n   \n2. **Development and Configuration Files**:\n   - Directories like `.claude/`, `.github/`, and files like `.vscode/`, `.idea/` are excluded to prevent IDE-specific configurations and project management files from being included.\n\n3. **Cache Files**:\n   - Files and directories such as `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, and various cache directories are excluded to avoid unnecessary bloat in the image.\n\n4. **Virtual Environments**:\n   - Excluding `.venv` and `venv/` ensures that local Python environments do not get packaged into the image.\n\n5. **Editor and Build Artifacts**:\n   - Folders like `dist/` and editor-specific files are ignored to keep the image clean.\n\n6. **Data Files**:\n   - Common data file types (e.g., `.gif`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, etc.) are excluded unless they are essential for the application.\n\n7. **Secrets and Sensitive Files**:\n   - Files like `secrets.env`, `.env`, and other sensitive credentials are explicitly excluded to enhance security.\n\n#### Actionable Steps to Build and Run Docker\n\n1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/get-started).\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:\n   ```bash\n   cd path/to/browser-use\n   ```\n\n3. **Build the Docker Image**:\n   Use the following command to build the Docker image, replacing `your-image-name` with your desired image name:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t your-image-name .\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Docker Container**:\n   After building the image, you can run it using:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -d your-image-name\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Container is Running**:\n   Check the running containers with:\n   ```bash\n   docker ps\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you will efficiently build and run your Docker container while ensuring that unnecessary and sensitive files are excluded from the build context."
