    ".dockerignore": "### Building and Running Docker with `.dockerignore` in langflow-ai/langflow\n\n#### Overview of `.dockerignore`\n\nThe `.dockerignore` file is used to specify files and directories that should be excluded from the Docker build context. This helps to reduce the size of the Docker image, speeds up the build process, and prevents sensitive or unnecessary files from being included in the image. \n\n#### Semantic Meaning of the Entries\n\n1. **`src/frontend/node_modules`**: Excludes the `node_modules` directory, which contains installed packages that can be restored via `npm install`.\n2. **`src/frontend/build`**: Excludes the build artifacts, which can be regenerated.\n3. **`src/frontend/coverage`**: Excludes code coverage reports, typically not needed in the image.\n4. **`src/frontend/test-results`**: Excludes test result files, which are not required for production.\n5. **`src/frontend/playwright-report`**: Excludes Playwright test reports, similar to test results.\n6. **`src/frontend/.dspy_cache`**: Excludes cache files generated by development tools.\n7. **`**/.DS_Store`**: Excludes macOS-specific metadata files.\n8. **`**/__pycache__`**: Excludes Python bytecode cache directories.\n9. **`**/*.pyc`**: Excludes Python compiled files.\n10. **`**/.pytest_cache`**: Excludes pytest cache files.\n11. **`**/.venv`**: Excludes virtual environment directories.\n12. **`**/.env`**: Excludes environment variable files, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n#### Building and Running Docker\n\nTo build and run the Docker container for the `langflow-ai/langflow` repository, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow.git\n   cd langflow\n   ```\n\n2. **Build the Docker Image**:\n   Use the following command to build the Docker image. Make sure you are in the root directory of the repository where the `Dockerfile` is located.\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t langflow .\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Docker Container**:\n   After building the image, run the container using:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 langflow\n   ```\n\n4. **Access the Application**:\n   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.\n\n#### Note\n\nEnsure that you have Docker installed and running on your machine before executing these commands. Adjust the port mapping (`-p 8080:8080`) as necessary based on your application's configuration."
