      "\n### For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm\n\nTry running it with this command if you have issues:\n\nFor 6700, 6600 and maybe other RDNA2 or older: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python main.py```\n\nFor AMD 7600 and maybe other RDNA3 cards: ```HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0 python main.py```\n\n### AMD ROCm Tips\n\nYou can enable experimental memory efficient attention on recent pytorch in ComfyUI on some AMD GPUs using this command, it should already be enabled by default on RDNA3. If this improves speed for you on latest pytorch on your GPU please report it so that I can enable it by default.\n"
