      "Dockerfile": "To build and run the Docker image from the Z4nzu/hackingtool repository, follow these steps:\n\n### Building the Docker Image\n\n1. **Base Image**: The Docker image is based on the latest version of Kali Linux, a distribution known for its penetration testing tools. This provides a robust environment for security-related tasks.\n\n2. **Dependencies**: During the build process, several essential packages are installed:\n   - **Git**: For version control and managing code repositories.\n   - **Python3 and pip**: To run Python scripts and manage Python packages.\n   - **Figlet**: For creating large text banners in the terminal.\n   - **Sudo**: To allow users to run commands with elevated privileges.\n   - **Boxes**: For creating text-based boxes in the terminal.\n   - **PHP, Curl, xdotool, and wget**: Various utilities for web interaction, automation, and downloading files.\n\n3. **Working Directory**: The working directory is set to `/root/hackingtool`, where the application code will reside.\n\n4. **Python Dependencies**: A `requirements.txt` file is copied into the image, and the necessary Python packages (including Flask for web applications and Requests for HTTP requests) are installed without caching to save space.\n\n5. **Application Code**: The entire application code is copied into the image.\n\n6. **Path Storage**: A text file is created to store the path to the hacking tool, which can be useful for reference or configuration.\n\n7. **Port Exposure**: The image exposes all ports from 1 to 65535, allowing for a wide range of network interactions and services.\n\n8. **Entrypoint**: The container is configured to run a Python script (`hackingtool.py`) when started, which is the main application logic.\n\n### Running the Docker Container\n\n1. **Build the Image**: Use the Docker build command to create the image from the Dockerfile. This will compile all the dependencies and set up the environment as described.\n\n2. **Start the Container**: You can use Docker Compose to start the container in detached mode with the command `docker-compose up -d`. This will ensure that the application runs in the background.\n\n3. **Access the Container**: To interact with the container, use the command `docker exec -it hackingtool bash`. This will open a shell session inside the running container, allowing you to execute commands and interact with the application directly.\n\n### Purpose of the Image\n\nThe primary purpose of this Docker image is to provide a comprehensive environment for running a hacking tool that likely includes various security testing functionalities. It simplifies the setup process by bundling all necessary dependencies and configurations into a single container, making it easy to deploy and use in different environments.",
      "docker-compose.yml": "To build and run the Docker image using the `docker-compose.yml` file from the Z4nzu/hackingtool repository, follow these steps:\n\n### Purpose of the Image\nThe Docker image, named `vgpastor/hackingtool`, is designed to provide a comprehensive environment for penetration testing and ethical hacking. It includes a variety of pre-installed tools and utilities that facilitate security assessments and vulnerability analysis. The image is built to support various hacking methodologies, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced security professionals.\n\n### Dependencies\nThe image relies on several underlying packages and libraries that are essential for running the included hacking tools effectively. These dependencies may include networking utilities, programming languages, and specific libraries tailored for security testing. The container is configured to allow interactive sessions, enabling users to execute commands and scripts directly within the environment.\n\n### Building and Running Steps\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the Z4nzu/hackingtool repository to your local machine. This will give you access to the `docker-compose.yml` file along with any other necessary resources.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your working directory to the location where the `docker-compose.yml` file is stored.\n\n3. **Build and Run the Container**: Use Docker Compose to build and run the container in detached mode. This command initializes the container based on the specifications in the `docker-compose.yml` file, setting up the necessary environment and dependencies.\n\n4. **Access the Container**: Once the container is running, you can access it interactively. This allows you to use the tools and utilities installed within the container. You will be able to execute commands as if you were using a standard terminal.\n\n5. **Volume Mapping**: The configuration includes volume mapping that links your local directory to the container's `/root/hackingtool` directory. This setup enables you to easily manage files and scripts between your host machine and the container.\n\n6. **Port Configuration**: The container is set to expose port 22, which allows for SSH access. This can be useful for remote management or for running specific tools that require SSH connectivity.\n\nBy following these steps, you will successfully build and run the Docker container, providing you with a powerful environment for ethical hacking and security testing."
