    "Dockerfile": "To build and run the Docker image for the `psf/black` repository, follow these steps:\n\n### Purpose of the Image\nThe Docker image is designed to encapsulate the `black` code formatter for Python, providing a consistent environment for formatting Python code. It includes all necessary dependencies and tools required to run `black` effectively.\n\n### Building the Image\n1. **Base Image**: The build process starts from a lightweight Python 3.12 slim image, which minimizes the image size while still providing the necessary Python environment.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Build Environment**:\n   - A directory named `/src` is created to hold the source code.\n   - The entire content of the repository is copied into this directory.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**:\n   - The `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable is set to specify the location of the virtual environment.\n   - The `HATCH_BUILD_HOOKS_ENABLE` variable is enabled to allow for custom build hooks during the package build process.\n\n4. **Installing Build Tools**:\n   - Essential build tools and dependencies are installed, including `build-essential`, `git`, and `python3-dev`. These tools are necessary for compiling the `black` package and its dependencies.\n\n5. **Creating a Virtual Environment**:\n   - A Python virtual environment is created at the specified `VIRTUAL_ENV` location.\n\n6. **Installing Build Dependencies**:\n   - The `hatch`, `hatch-fancy-pypi-readme`, and `hatch-vcs` packages are installed to facilitate the building of the `black` package.\n\n7. **Building and Installing `black`**:\n   - The `pip` tool is upgraded, and then the `black` package is built and installed from the source code located in `/src`. This includes the installation of additional dependencies like `colorama`, `d`, and `uvloop`.\n\n### Final Image Creation\nAfter the build stage, a second slim Python 3.12 image is created. The virtual environment containing the installed `black` package is copied from the builder stage to this final image. The `PATH` environment variable is updated to include the virtual environment's `bin` directory, ensuring that the `black` command is easily accessible.\n\n### Running the Image\nTo run the Docker container, execute the command that invokes the `black` formatter. This command will utilize the installed `black` package within the virtual environment, allowing you to format Python files as needed.\n\n### Summary\nThis Docker image provides a streamlined, isolated environment for using the `black` code formatter, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly managed and that the tool can be executed without conflicts or issues related to the host system's Python environment."
