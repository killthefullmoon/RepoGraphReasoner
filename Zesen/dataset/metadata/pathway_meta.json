The image will contain all necessary dependencies and tools required to compile and run the application efficiently.\n\n### Building Steps\n\n1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can verify this by running `docker --version` in your terminal.\n\n2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway.git\n   cd pathway\n   ```\n\n3. **Review the `.dockerignore` File**: The `.dockerignore` file specifies which files and directories should be excluded from the Docker build context. In this case, it ignores everything in the `target/debug/` directory, except for any `.whl` files within that directory. This helps to reduce the image size by excluding unnecessary build artifacts.\n\n4. **Build the Docker Image**: Use the Docker build command to create the image. This process will read the Dockerfile in the repository and use the context defined by the `.dockerignore` file to include only the necessary files. The build process will install dependencies specified in the Dockerfile, which may include Rust toolchains, libraries, and any other required packages.\n\n5. **Tag the Image**: Optionally, tag the image with a meaningful name for easier identification. This can be done during the build process.\n\n6. **Run the Docker Container**: Once the image is built, you can run a container from the image. This container will have all the dependencies installed and will allow you to execute the application in an isolated environment.\n\n### Dependencies\nThe built image will likely include:\n- The Rust programming language and its toolchain for compiling the application.\n- Any additional libraries or tools specified in the Dockerfile that are necessary for the application to run correctly.\n- The `.whl` files from the `target/debug/` directory, which may include Python packages if the application has Python components.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these steps, you will successfully build and run a Docker image for the application in the `pathwaycom/pathway` repository, ensuring that you have a consistent and isolated environment for development and testing."
